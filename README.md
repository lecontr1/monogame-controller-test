# monogame-controller-test
Inputhelper class for use in Monogame/XNA framework. Currently in development. 

This helper class is used for controller and keyboard inputs in the Monogame/XNA framework. Hoping to implement 
generic controller support in the near future. Uses the SharpDX library for generic controller support and Monogame 
input library for keyboard and X-input controllers.
